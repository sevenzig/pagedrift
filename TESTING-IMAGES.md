# Testing Image Rendering Fix

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\scootypuffjr\Projects\ebook-reader\EBookVoyage\EBookVoyage
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (Press F12)

3. **Upload an EPUB file with images**

4. **Check the console output:**
   - Look for `📚 EPUB Archive Contents:` to see all files in the EPUB
   - Look for `✓ Image loaded:` messages showing successful image loads
   - Look for `✗ Failed to load image:` messages if any images fail

5. **Open the book and verify images render**

## What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Console shows: `✓ Image loaded: [original-path] → [resolved-path]`
- Images display correctly in the reader
- No broken image icons

### ❌ Failure Indicators:
- Console shows: `✗ Failed to load image: [path]`
- Console shows: `Attempted paths: [array of paths]`
- Broken image icons in the reader

## Debugging Failed Images

If images still don't load:

1. **Check the archive contents:**
   - Look at the `📚 EPUB Archive Contents:` log
   - Find where the images are actually stored in the EPUB
   - Example: If you see `OEBPS/media/image1.jpg` in the list

2. **Check the attempted paths:**
   - Look at the `Attempted paths:` array in the error log
   - See if any of the attempted paths match the actual location

3. **Report the issue:**
   - Copy the archive contents list
   - Copy the failed image path
   - Copy the attempted paths list
   - This will help identify what additional path strategies are needed

## Common EPUB Structures

The parser now handles these common structures:

```
Standard EPUB:
├── OEBPS/
│   ├── content.opf
│   ├── chapters/
│   │   └── chapter1.xhtml (contains: <img src="../images/pic.jpg">)
│   └── images/
│       └── pic.jpg

Alternative Structure:
├── content.opf
├── chapters/
│   └── chapter1.xhtml (contains: <img src="../images/pic.jpg">)
└── images/
    └── pic.jpg

Flat Structure:
├── content.opf
├── chapter1.xhtml (contains: <img src="images/pic.jpg">)
└── images/
    └── pic.jpg
```

## Example Console Output

### Good Output:
```
📚 EPUB Archive Contents: (50) ['mimetype', 'META-INF/container.xml', 'OEBPS/content.opf', 'OEBPS/chapters/chapter1.xhtml', 'OEBPS/images/cover.jpg', 'OEBPS/images/diagram1.png', ...]

✓ Image loaded: ../images/cover.jpg → OEBPS/images/cover.jpg
✓ Image loaded: ../images/diagram1.png → OEBPS/images/diagram1.png
```

### Problem Output:
```
📚 EPUB Archive Contents: (50) ['mimetype', 'META-INF/container.xml', 'OEBPS/content.opf', 'OEBPS/chapters/chapter1.xhtml', 'OEBPS/media/cover.jpg', ...]

✗ Failed to load image: ../images/cover.jpg
  Attempted paths: (12) ['../images/cover.jpg', 'OEBPS/images/cover.jpg', 'images/cover.jpg', 'Images/cover.jpg', 'OEBPS/images/cover.jpg', 'OEBPS/Images/cover.jpg', 'image/cover.jpg', 'Image/cover.jpg']
```

In this case, the image is actually at `OEBPS/media/cover.jpg` but the parser tried `OEBPS/images/cover.jpg`. This would indicate we need to add `media/` to the common directories list.

## Performance Notes

- **First Load**: Images are processed and converted to base64 during EPUB parsing
- **Caching**: Images are cached in memory to avoid reprocessing
- **Storage**: Base64 images are stored in localStorage with the book data
- **Large EPUBs**: Books with many large images may take longer to parse

## Browser Compatibility

The fix uses standard browser APIs:
- FileReader API (for base64 conversion)
- Blob API (for image data handling)
- Should work in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
