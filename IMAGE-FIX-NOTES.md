# Image Rendering Fix - Implementation Notes

## Problem
Images in EPUB files were not rendering because the image URLs were being resolved incorrectly. The parser was unable to find the images within the EPUB archive.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Comprehensive Path Resolution Strategy**
The parser now tries multiple path resolution strategies to find images:

- **Relative path resolution**: Properly handles `../`, `./`, and relative paths
- **Common EPUB directories**: Tries standard locations like `images/`, `OEBPS/images/`, etc.
- **Absolute vs relative**: Handles both `/images/pic.jpg` and `images/pic.jpg`
- **Directory-aware resolution**: Resolves paths relative to the current chapter's location

### 2. **Multiple Loading Methods**
For each path, the parser tries two methods:
1. `book.archive.getBase64()` - Direct base64 extraction (most reliable)
2. `book.load()` with resolved URL - Alternative method with blob conversion

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues:
- Lists all files in the EPUB archive at load time
- Shows which paths are attempted for each image
- Reports successful image loads with the working path
- Reports failed loads with all attempted paths

## Path Resolution Strategies

The parser tries paths in this order:

1. **Original path** - As specified in the HTML
2. **Relative resolution** - Resolves `../` and `./` relative to current chapter
3. **Common directories** - Tries:
   - `images/[filename]`
   - `Images/[filename]`
   - `OEBPS/images/[filename]`
   - `OEBPS/Images/[filename]`
   - `image/[filename]`
   - `Image/[filename]`
4. **Without leading slash** - Removes leading `/` if present
5. **With OEBPS prefix** - Adds `OEBPS/` prefix (common EPUB structure)

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Upload an EPUB with images**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Look for these logs**:
   - `ðŸ“š EPUB Archive Contents:` - Shows all files in the EPUB
   - `âœ“ Image loaded:` - Shows successfully loaded images
   - `âœ— Failed to load image:` - Shows failed images with attempted paths

## Example Console Output

### Successful Load:
```
ðŸ“š EPUB Archive Contents: ['OEBPS/content.opf', 'OEBPS/chapter1.xhtml', 'OEBPS/images/cover.jpg', ...]
âœ“ Image loaded: ../images/cover.jpg â†’ OEBPS/images/cover.jpg
```

### Failed Load (with debug info):
```
âœ— Failed to load image: ../images/missing.jpg
  Attempted paths: ['../images/missing.jpg', 'OEBPS/images/missing.jpg', 'images/missing.jpg', ...]
```

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/parsers/epub-parser.ts` - Enhanced image path resolution

## Technical Details

### Path Resolution Algorithm

```typescript
// For a path like "../images/pic.jpg" in "OEBPS/chapters/chapter1.xhtml"
1. Original: "../images/pic.jpg"
2. Resolved: "OEBPS/images/pic.jpg" (go up one level from chapters/)
3. Fallback: "images/pic.jpg", "OEBPS/images/pic.jpg", etc.
```

### Caching
- Images are cached after first load to avoid redundant processing
- Cache key is the original `src` attribute
- Cache value is the base64 data URL

## Known Limitations

1. **EPUB Structure Variations**: Some EPUBs use non-standard directory structures
2. **DRM Protection**: DRM-protected images cannot be extracted
3. **External Images**: HTTP/HTTPS URLs are not converted to base64
4. **Large Images**: Very large images may impact performance

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more EPUB directory structures
2. Implement image compression for large files
3. Add option to disable image loading for faster parsing
4. Support for SVG images with embedded resources
