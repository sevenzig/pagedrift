# Test Upload Functionality

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks in all parsers
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Validation for empty files and corrupted content

### 2. **Improved EPUB Parser**
- Better error handling for individual chapters
- Validation that content was actually extracted
- More robust metadata extraction

### 3. **Enhanced PDF Parser**
- Updated PDF.js worker URL to use unpkg (more reliable)
- Added PDF loading options for better compatibility
- Better error handling for individual pages
- Validation for empty PDFs

### 4. **Enhanced MOBI Parser** 
- Full MOBI/AZW3 support with @lingo-reader/mobi-parser library
- Comprehensive metadata extraction (title, author, publisher, ISBN, etc.)
- HTML content extraction and Markdown conversion
- Cover image extraction
- Embedded image support with base64 encoding
- Real chapter structure from TOC or headings
- First pages text extraction for metadata lookup

### 5. **Upload Component Improvements**
- Added success message display
- File input reset after successful upload
- Better error state management
- Enhanced file validation (empty files, null checks)

### 6. **File Validation Enhancements**
- Check for null/undefined files
- Validate file size > 0
- Better error messages

## How to Test

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\scootypuffjr\Projects\ebook-reader\pagedrift\pagedrift
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with different file types:**
   - Try uploading an EPUB file
   - Try uploading a PDF file  
   - Try uploading a MOBI file
   - Try uploading an invalid file type
   - Try uploading an empty file
   - Try uploading a file > 50MB

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Success message should appear for valid files
   - Error messages should be clear and helpful
   - File input should reset after successful upload
   - Books should appear in the library after upload

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If upload still fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Ensure file is not corrupted
3. Try with a smaller file first
4. Check network connectivity (for PDF.js worker)

### For EPUB files:
- Some EPUB files may have complex structures that cause parsing issues
- The parser will skip problematic chapters and continue with others

### For PDF files:
- PDF.js worker loads from CDN, requires internet connection
- Some PDFs may be image-based and won't extract text well

### For MOBI files:
- Enhanced MOBI parser now extracts metadata, images, and proper chapter structure
- DRM-protected MOBI files cannot be parsed (remove DRM first with Calibre)
- MOBI/AZW3 formats are fully supported
